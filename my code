This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a **simple** formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 
```{r}
summary(cars)
```
You can embed R code into text like this:
1. To show the mean stopping distance: `r mean(cars$dist)` reported in cars.
2. To show the standard deviation of stopping distance:  `r sd(cars$dist)` reported in cars.
3. To show the minimum stopping distance:  `r min(cars$dist)` reported in cars.
Lets look at the first six lines of cars

```{r}
head(cars)
```

You can also include plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk above to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
Here is what you get with 'echo = FALSE'

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Look at the number of discoveries over many years

```{r}
plot(discoveries)
```

Look at the European markets

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

Try another kind of plot

```{r}

```

Look at presidential approval over time
