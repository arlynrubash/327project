This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a **simple** formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 
```{r}
summary(cars)
```
You can embed R code into text like this:
1. To show the mean stopping distance: `r mean(cars$dist)` reported in cars.
2. To show the standard deviation of stopping distance:  `r sd(cars$dist)` reported in cars.
3. To show the minimum stopping distance:  `r min(cars$dist)` reported in cars.
Lets look at the first six lines of cars
```{r}
head(cars)
```
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk above to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
Here is how it looks with 'echo = TRUE'
```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```
Look at discoveries over many years
```{r}
plot(discoveries)
```
Look at the euro
```{r}
plot(EuStockMarkets)
```
```{r}
str(JohnsonJohnson)
```
Graph of JohnsonJohnson quarterly earnings
```{r}
plot(JohnsonJohnson)
```
Try another kind of plot
```{r}
plot(occupationalStatus)
```
Look at presidential approval
```{r}
plot(presidents)
```
Here is a graphical representation of US State centers
```{r}
plot(state.center)
```
Look at Internet usage
```{r}
plot(WWWusage)
```
